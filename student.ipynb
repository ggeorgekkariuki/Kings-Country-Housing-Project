    "\n",
    "King County has witnessed a vibrant real estate market. The housing market in this county is competitive and homeowners looking to buy or sell properties frequently seek guidence from local estate agencies. One of the key services they provide is advising homeowners on how renovations can potentially increase the value of their homes before listing them on the market. However, the agency faces the challenge of accurately quantifying the impact of various renovation features on the selling price of homes in the county. To address this challenge, the agency seeks to leverage data analysis and regression modeling to provide homeowners with informed recommendations on which renovations are likely to yield the highest returns.\n",
