    "## Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "Background information\n",
    "King County, Washington, is a diversified area encompassing urban, suburban, and rural areas. The housing market is fiercely competitive, fueled by substantial demand from homebuyers and investors. The county provides a variety of housing alternatives, including single-family houses, condominiums, townhouses, apartments, and luxurious estates. The county is home to exceptional schools and educational organizations, including the University of Washington.\n",
    "\n",
    "The county's robust transportation system effects home demand and pricing. Hiking, skiing, boating, and fishing are all outdoor recreational activities. King County homes provide a desirable balance of natural beauty, economic prospects, and quality of life amenities, making them a popular choice for both homeowners and investors. However, successfully navigating the housing market involves careful study, planning, and consideration of individual requirements and preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "The project analyses home prices and market trends using the King County House Sales dataset. It employs data analytics and predictive modelling to identify improvements that yield the maximum return on investment. The key purpose therefor, is to develop an advice system for a real estate agency in King County, Washington, that will assist homeowners in understanding how home modifications effect the projected value of their property.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Problem: \n",
    "The goal is to deliver insights to the real estate agency on how to improve return on investment by predicting the price of estates by homeowners based on specific factors. Some of the key objectives include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Examining which renovation factors have the biggest effects on raising a home's assessed value, i.e. a. how much will the sale price likely increase by adding floors? b. how much will the sale price likely increase by adding bedrooms? c. what is the expected rise in the selling price of a house that has an addition to its living area?\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, there are additional goals as well: developing a predictive model that projects a home's market value growth depending on renovation elements; and tracking trends in the real estate market.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solutions to be offered by our analysis**:\n",

    "3. To identify Key Factors: Examine how the square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and grade affect home values in King County.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. To predict Market Trends: Using historical data and projections, create predictive models in order to forecast trends in markets and property values.\n",
    "\n",
