    "# Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "Background information\n",
    "King County, Washington, is a diversified area encompassing urban, suburban, and rural areas. The housing market is fiercely competitive, fueled by substantial demand from homebuyers and investors. The county provides a variety of housing alternatives, including single-family houses, condominiums, townhouses, apartments, and luxurious estates. The county is home to exceptional schools and educational organizations, including the University of Washington.\n",
    "\n",
    "The county's robust transportation system effects home demand and pricing. Hiking, skiing, boating, and fishing are all outdoor recreational activities. King County homes provide a desirable balance of natural beauty, economic prospects, and quality of life amenities, making them a popular choice for both homeowners and investors. However, successfully navigating the housing market involves careful study, planning, and consideration of individual requirements and preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "The project analyses home prices and market trends using the King County House Sales dataset. It employs data analytics and predictive modelling to identify improvements that yield the maximum return on investment. The key purpose therefor, is to develop an advice system for a real estate agency in King County, Washington, that will assist homeowners in understanding how home modifications effect the projected value of their property.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Problem: \n",
    "The goal is to deliver insights to the real estate agency on how to improve return on investment by predicting the price of estates by homeowners based on specific factors. Some of the key objectives include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Examining which renovation factors have the biggest effects on raising a home's assessed value, i.e. a. how much will the sale price likely increase by adding floors? b. how much will the sale price likely increase by adding bedrooms? c. what is the expected rise in the selling price of a house that has an addition to its living area?\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, there are additional goals as well: developing a predictive model that projects a home's market value growth depending on renovation elements; and tracking trends in the real estate market.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solutions to be offered by our analysis**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Current Market Trends and Best-Performing Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. What types of homes are currently selling the best in the market (based on price)?\n",
    "    b. What factors distinguish top-performing properties in terms of sale price?\n",
    "    c. Which residences have performed the best financially?\n",
    "\n",
    "Popular Features and Preferences Across Time:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. Which housing features and attributes have proven most popular and successful throughout time?\n",
    "    b. What are current trends in homebuyers' feature preferences?\n",
    "    c. What are homebuyers' preferences according to property ratings and reviews?\n",
    "    d. What types of home features appeal to potential buyers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Home Renovations and Sale Price: \n",
    "\n",
    "    a. How does adding floors affect the sale price of a home?\n",
    "    b. How does the addition of bedrooms affect the sale price of a home?\n",
    "    c. What is the predicted rise in the selling price of a home after an addition to its living space?\n",
    "\n",
    "Seasonal Trends & Optimal Time to Sell: \n",
    "\n",
    "    a. Do home sales and prices follow seasonal patterns?\n",
    "    b. When is the greatest time to sell a home for the highest possible price?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "1. To determine if price is affected by presence of waterfront and condition?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To explore which features will decrease and increase value of the house (renovation).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To identify Key Factors: Examine how the square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and grade affect home values in King County.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. To predict Market Trends: Using historical data and projections, create predictive models in order to forecast trends in markets and property values.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. To give recommendation: Give potential homeowners personalized advice based on their tastes, budget, and investment goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which factors determines the price of a home?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. How square feet living affect the value of a home?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. How condition affect the price of a home?\n",

    "# Data Understanding\n",
    "In order to predict the sales price of properties in King County, the research extracts data from the King County House Sales dataset, which includes the kc_house_data.csv file.\n",
    "\n",
    "It includes 20 homes, 21,597 housing observations, and a column containing the home ID. Homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015 are included in the data. The following are a few pertinent columns to be used in this analysis: price - the amount at which the property was previously sold, bedrooms - the number of bedrooms, bathrooms - the number of bathrooms, sqft_living - the square footage of the home's living area, sqft_lot - the square footage of the lot, floors - the total number of levels in the house, and grade - the overall grade of the property. Concerning the building and layout of the house as well as the year the house was built (yr_built)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables\n",
    "The aim variable in this project is the \"price\" of the properties. This suggests that the result or objective variable is predicted or explained by other independent factors, such as the property's characteristics (square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc.). In statistical modelling and analysis, the variable being modelled or projected based on the values of other variables is the price of a property. These variables will be utilized to provide answers to the data inquiries and provide the real estate firm with useful information on how to forecast prices based on characteristics that influence sales. Additional variables consist of bedrooms, square footage, flooring, grade, year of construction, year of renovation, and sale date. More information on the variables is given at the end of the document."
